  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p class="quintin">
    According to Classic Album Sundays, the context of Pink Floyd's 1975 album <em>Wish You Were Here</em>
    is centered on two main themes: the band's disillusionment with the music industry and their profound
    sense of loss for former bandmate Syd Barrett.
