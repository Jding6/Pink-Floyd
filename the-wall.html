    According to The Wall Analysis, Pink Floyd's <em>The Wall</em> is one of the most intriguing and
    imaginative albums in the history of rock music. Since the studio album's release in 1979, the tour
    of 1980–81, and the subsequent movie of 1982, The Wall has become synonymous with the term
    "concept album."
